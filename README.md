### Procedural
Procedural language uses programming languages like Pascal, c++, Fortran  and c; these are very detailed and will take up alot of time when writing them. Procedural language is a list of instructions that tell the computer exactly what to do. It will make sure the computer knows step-by-step exactly what to do and how to perform each line of code until the code is finished. It relies on the programmer to do a lot of the work and the programmer will need to provide a solution to a problem or to proivde an answer to a question. It keeps the code as short as possible and somewhere in the code it will contain a sequence of steps that it needs to carry out. Additionally, it does not allow the programmer to copy and paste the code onto another program. Lastly, it can be very difficult to learn because it can take time getting used it.
